- Why did you build this project? To better manage my time during work hours
  and to Better display my skills and assets as a software developer

- What problem does it solve? This application can be used to manage 
  time at work. It uses a simple model of only 9am - 5pm.

  Untill reset at 6pm every night. Feilds will change back to future from past after 12PM.
